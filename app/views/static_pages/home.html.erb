		<p>DNA/Paternity testing determines the biological father of a child. We all inherit our DNA from our biological parents, half from our mother and half from our father.
		A DNA paternity test compares a child's DNA pattern with that of an "alleged father" to determine if there is a match.<br>
		<span>When performed correctly in an experienced laboratory, it is the most definitive proof of a biological relationship.</span></p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			No Hidden Charges
			Other paternity testing companies have hidden costs and will charge an additional fee to provide the results once testing has been completed. All of the costs to collect the sample, process the result, and report the result back to the requester are included in the prices quotes by us, guaranteed.
