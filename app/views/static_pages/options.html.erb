						During this process, a member of our staff will perform the test, while maintaining the required chain of custody.
		       	You will be provided with a court admissible document.

					<div class="clearfix"></div>

	      	<p>Siblingship DNA testing is conducted to determine if two children share one or both parents (i.e., if they are half or full siblings). It is an indirect way to determine family relationships when an alleged father is not available for a paternity test. A siblingship test starts with the analysis of known relatives.</p>

	        <p>
	        	If Siblings 1 and 2 do not share the same mother, but want to find out if they share the same biological father, a half siblingship test is performed.
						<br>
	        	If Siblings 1 and 2 share the same biological mother, but are unsure if they share the same biological father, a full siblingship test is performed. In the test, the siblings’ DNA profiles are compared to see how much of their DNA could have come from a common father.
						<br>
	        	Participation of the mother(s) is encouraged to help exclude the mother’s contribution to the children’s DNA. Siblingship tests require more analysis, and they could be more costly and take a longer time to complete without the mother’s participation.
	        </p>
	        <p>Results of a siblingship test may be used as proof in Social Security benefit and other inheritance claims.</p>

	      	<p>A grandparentage test is used to determine whether a person is the true biological grandparent of a child.
	      	It is usually used when the parent of the child is not available for testing.</p>

					<p><b>Two types of Grand paternity testing options:</b></p>
					<p><b>Single Grandparent DNA Analysis:</b><br>
				 	This DNA test includes 1 grandparent, 1 grandchild, and parent (optional, but strongly suggested). The conclusive range for DNA results are either greater than 90% inclusion, or less than 10% exclusion probabilities.</p>

					<p><b>Duo Grandparent DNA Analysis:</b><br>
				  This DNA test includes BOTH grandparents, 1 child, and parent (optional, but strongly suggested). For the most accurate results in a grandparent analysis,
				  it is best to include both the alleged grandparents and the child. When both alleged grandparents are included, the DNA results can indicate greater than 99.99% probability
				  (for inclusions), or 100% (for exclusions).</p>

					<p><b>Procedure:</b><br>
			    Samples are collected from one or both grandparents, and the grandchild, at home or at a collection center (a known parent is optional, but strongly suggested).
			    Results will be available within 5-10 Business Days.</p>
